**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the HTML exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** Most of this was review, but there were a few things near the end that I had forgotten about. Next section is on Bootstrap, and that's totally new to me, so I'm looking forward to it. 
I also spent some time working on an app for a client, which should count, because I'm experimenting with functional programming and observable sequences in Javascript when there was really no need to. It was just to see if I can do it. Will probably migrate that to GitHub for visibility rather than in my Amazon CodeCommit repo.
