# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: January 15, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic Algorithm Scripting JS exercises and FreeCodeCamp's JSON APIs and AJAX series. Time to build the Random Quote Machine next!

**Thoughts**  
The Falsy Bouncer problem was a lot harder to solve than I thought... I had to resort to checking if x !== x for isNaN, otherwise I couldn't tell the difference between a string and NaN.  
I learned about the arguments property today. I don't see how it should be used unless you've designed yourself into a corner

### Day 10: January 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio page and JS exercises

**Thoughts**  
I twiddled with the Portfolio page a little bit, adding some Flex container to try and even out the thumbnails... and then ripped through a bunch of Javascript exercises, trying to do them as functionally(?) as I can

### Day 9: January 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio page

**Thoughts**  
I finished all the user stories for the portfolio page... to the letter. Needs more time to be "nice" though. I'll either work on that tomorrow, or move on :)

### Day 8: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio page

**Thoughts**  
Found a really awesome Bootstrap tutorial on w3schools that I'm going to check out tomorrow. Mostly today I spent fiddling with the nav bar and trying to see how it ticks. I've converted to using Pug because it's so much more terse than straight HTML.

### Day 7: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started Portfolio page

**Thoughts**  
Had a massive design paralysis issue. Spent several hours figuring out what I want to do. Found a really cool site for design, and that's canva.com. In the end I've opted to go with a simple design for now, and get fancier as it gets more complete, if so desired

### Day 6: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked toward my img-to-amp transformer

**Thoughts**  
I was tempted today for the first time to skip. Today was so draining, but I pushed through and made a little bit of progress on my conversion app. I can see the end of it; I just need to push a little bit more!

### Day 5: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally done the Tribute page

**Thoughts**  
It turned out the carousel needed the same size of image. I spent some time resizing them, and now it looks good. I'm not totally happy with the inner text, but I don't think it's the end of the world; it got the point across.

### Day 4: January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the Tribute page

**Thoughts**  
I'm not sure how many hours I spent on this. It went from child-like, to bad, to worse, to hey I'm not too embarrassed by this. I've started to overcome all the options that are present in Bootstrap. And looking at examples on Bootstrap's page... it's like looking at a completely different language! I should record my current progress on this tribute page to show how far I've come.

### Day 3: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the jQuery exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and started on the Tribute page

**Thoughts**  
Working through exercises is a completely different beast from designing a webpage from scratch. This is a lot harder than I thought! I don't find the documentation for Bootstrap very good -- at least I haven't found a comprehensive list. There's a number of examples that are on the website that I have run View Source on, and after copying and pasting the same code into CodePen, it behaves differently.

### Day 2: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the Bootstrap exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**  
Had to cut it short today. Ultimate Frisbee night.

All these divs nested inside one another seems tedious and it quickly becomes cluttered with a small text input area. The benefits of using Bootstrap outweigh that complaint though, especially when it comes to using the grids. In the tutorial, they tell you to use col-xs-*, but how do we know to use that compared to the medium-sized ones? Isn't that the point of being responsive in the first place?
The layout that was built is also set up for the jQuery section coming up.

Also, Font Awesome is pretty cool.

### Day 1: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the HTML exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**  
Most of this was review, but there were a few things near the end that I had forgotten about. Next section is on Bootstrap, and that's totally new to me, so I'm looking forward to it.  

I also spent some time working on an app for a client, which should count, because I'm experimenting with functional programming and observable sequences in Javascript when there was really no need to. It was just to see if I can do it. Will probably migrate that to GitHub for visibility rather than in my Amazon CodeCommit repo.  

I ended up spending a few minutes going over a few of the Bootstrap lessons too.
