**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the HTML exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**  
Most of this was review, but there were a few things near the end that I had forgotten about. Next section is on Bootstrap, and that's totally new to me, so I'm looking forward to it.  

I also spent some time working on an app for a client, which should count, because I'm experimenting with functional programming and observable sequences in Javascript when there was really no need to. It was just to see if I can do it. Will probably migrate that to GitHub for visibility rather than in my Amazon CodeCommit repo.  

I ended up spending a few minutes going over a few of the Bootstrap lessons too.

### Day 2: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through all the Bootstrap exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**  
Had to cut it short today. Ultimate Frisbee night.

All these divs nested inside one another seems tedious and it quickly becomes cluttered with a small text input area. The benefits of using Bootstrap outweigh that complaint though, especially when it comes to using the grids. In the tutorial, they tell you to use col-xs-*, but how do we know to use that compared to the medium-sized ones? Isn't that the point of being responsive in the first place?
The layout that was built is also set up for the jQuery section coming up.

Also, Font Awesome is pretty cool.
